# pcrec-memory-functions — journal

Append-only, dated, newest last. One entry per significant work session
or delivery: what was done, what was measured (both layers, D147, with
box and regime), issues, next steps. Never edit an entry away; correct
it with a later one. pcrec's `docs/dev/dev_journal.md` gets a one-line
pointer when a kit change merges to main.

### 2026-10-05 — subtree set up (lane memfnsetup)

- Frank's rulings: D146 (delegation), D147 (layers: the scalar layer is
  live and improvable forever, SIMD is a layer that must beat the
  CURRENT scalar, both layers reported), Q35 (integration.md §8+§14 is
  the design of record), Q36 (in-tree `memfn/`, `pcrec_mf_*` symbols,
  0BSD, extraction on a measured trigger: a stable API over several
  migration steps AND a real second consumer).
- Set up: CLAUDE.md, README.md, LICENSE (0BSD), the ledger pair
  (`requests.md`, `responses.md`), this journal, the session wake
  template, `src/`/`include/`/`tests/` with planned-contents stubs. No
  code and no Makefile wiring: the first code lands with R4a (D77).
- integration.md revised to 4.2 for D147 (the frozen baseline becomes a
  per-step comparator only; the SIMD-off profile is the current scalar
  layer; G1 reads each change against its own deny, in both layers).
- First request filed: R-1, the R4b measurement (T-B twin re-run on
  Linux on the post-handoff build, with a SWAR fused variant).
