# docs/spec/ — spec documents

Spec documents detail how the tool and its surfaces actually work and how to
use them. They are deliverables like code: actively maintained (not
append-only), carry no build history, and may reference docs/design/
documents for the reasoning behind a design without repeating it.

Build history is NOT part of the spec (Frank, 2026-08-14): how a surface
came to be — panel outcomes, refuted predictions, rulings, the design
process — stays in docs/design/ and docs/dev/. A spec may refer to design
documents but only INFORMATIONALLY: such references are background for the
curious reader, never normative. The spec alone states the contract; if a
spec and a design doc disagree, the spec is what the tool promises.

- `match_api.md` — **[M4.7f], 2026-08-18: the FIRST spec document.** The
  as-built match-API contract: the generated artifact's entry points
  (`<prefix>_search`/`_match`/`_match_caps`/`_info`), the six fixed-literal
  ABI types (`rx_ctx`, `rx_matchfn`, `rx_callout_ref`, `rx_group_entry`,
  `struct rx_info`, `rx_renderfn`), capture-slot semantics (the C1–C11
  requirements restated as contract prose, with the R22 cross-iteration-
  retention/empty-final-iteration-overwrite rules folded in as first-class
  text, not an addendum), the D49 give-up code space
  (`RX_ERR_STEPS`/`_FRAMES`/`_WORK`, the `RX_ERR_FLOOR` partition), the
  `rx_info` reflection structure and its D46 compile-time observability
  macro mirror, the compile-entry NUL-termination contract (with an
  independently measured libpcre2 10.46 comparison — `PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED`
  truncates identically), and `pcrec_options`/`pcrec_error`. Every claim
  is verified against the shipped surface (`lib/pcrec.h`, artifacts
  actually emitted by `build/pcrec`, cited tests) rather than copied from
  `docs/design/match_api_m4.md`, which had drifted from what shipped in
  one place (§3.5: the give-up-code collapse `match_api_m4.md` still
  describes was superseded by D49 before this graduation and the shipped
  artifact already implements the superseding rule) and carries one
  as-built deviation of its own (§2: `rx_info` ships as a struct TAG, not
  the bare typedef the design sketch showed — forced by a name collision
  with the default-prefix `<prefix>_info` instance, still open as a Frank
  ruling per `docs/dev/plan.md`'s history). References
  `docs/design/match_api_m4.md`/`engine_m4.md` informationally for the
  ruling history; this document alone states what pcrec promises.

Maintenance: update this file when files are added/removed or their roles
change.
