# pcrec Project Plan

Working plan derived from ../../APPROACH.md. Milestones M0–M7 mirror APPROACH §9.

## Step-state format (grep'able)

Every step line matches exactly:

    - [Mx.y] STATE:<state> — <title>

States: `not-started` | `started` | `completed` | `blocked` | `deferred`

Find work:

    grep -n "STATE:started" docs/dev/plan.md
    grep -n "STATE:not-started" docs/dev/plan.md
    grep -c "STATE:completed" docs/dev/plan.md

Completed-history greps (archived rows, not here) run against
docs/dev/plan_completed.md instead.

Rules: update the STATE tag in place when a step changes state; expand a milestone
into substeps only when work on it begins (replace its single `[Mx.0]` line);
note blockers inline after the title with `(blocked: reason)`.

## Queue discipline (Frank, 2026-08-12)

**The BOONIES TIER sits well after the general work.** [M4-CALLOUTS],
[M4-SUBST], [V-E], [V-F], [SR-10] and their kin are PARKING SPOTS, not queue
positions: recorded so nothing is re-derived, started only after the spine —
M3 streaming, M4 captures + backtracking VM engine, M5 UTF-8, M6 feature
modules, M7 differential fuzzing — is done, unless Frank explicitly pulls
one forward. A boonies row growing substeps while spine rows sit not-started
is the smell this note exists to stop.
(Spine order re-ruled 2026-08-13: STD1 → M4 → M5 → M6 → M3 → M7 — see
"Development order" below.)

## Development order (ratified 2026-08-13)

The spine, in this order, one line of rationale each (full session rationale:
dev_journal.md 2026-08-13, sixteenth session):

- **[STD1]** — its suite re-baseline only widens with time; land it before
  anything else queues behind it.
- **M4 — captures + backtracking VM engine** — the biggest user-visible gap
  (captures) and the owner of the most parked decisions ([DD-2], [DD-7],
  [DD-9], [SR-8]).
- **M5 — UTF-8** — before M6, so feature modules are born CharSet/UTF-aware
  ([DD-12], [DD-1]) instead of being rebuilt once UTF lands.
- **M6 — PCRE feature modules** — lookaround, backrefs, atomic groups,
  named-groups, conditionals, recursion. The assertions module is the one
  M6 piece that needs no VM — a flexible slot, schedulable whenever a lane
  is free.
- **M3 — streaming input** — moved to last-but-one because its API must be
  designed once against the FINAL engine+feature set ([OS-3]'s evidence —
  lookbehind/backref window retention); building it earlier would mean
  rebuilding it.
- **M7 — hardening** — differential fuzzing was already pulled forward (to
  M2); the residue is testdata import and the freestanding/embedded
  profile.

Sequencing notes: the backrefs / atomic-groups / substitution-template
design notes (under M4 below) should be WRITTEN BEFORE M4 starts — they are
M4's design customers, and the substitution template compiler is
matcher-independent (Frank, 2026-08-12), so its design note need not wait
on M4 either. [MECH-3] lands before [OPT-A] opens.

## Next: [STD1]

- [STD1] STATE:not-started — implement D37: the bare default becomes
  frozen named set `std1` = {classes, modifiers}; named-set plumbing
  (`--features std1|none|<explicit>`, older sets available verbatim
  forever, bare-default mapping advances only at announced version
  boundaries); artifact stamping (set name + expanded module list in
  emitted header + macro); FULL SUITE RE-BASELINE (reject_gated
  inversions, corpus `features` directives, check07 gate equivalence,
  PC-3 gate state all assume an empty default today); check09 per-name
  arming + check01 aperture/floors land here. Product-face change —
  starts with Frank's go, after MOD-0.8 closes

## M4 — Captures + backtracking VM engine

- [M4.0] STATE:not-started — milestone (expand on arrival): VM emitter, DFA-prefilter hybrid, DFA islands

Design notes moved here from [MOD-0.1]'s archived entry (docs/dev/plan_completed.md),
2026-08-13 — M4's design customers, per the Development order above:

**DESIGN NOTE FOR `backrefs` (Frank, 2026-08-12 tenth session): the
engines column's blanket VM_ONLY on the digit rows is provisional and
splits under an AOT compiler.** At match time a backreference is a string
compare against the group's captured text — which is exactly what the
backtracking VM will do, and what the DFA engine cannot (subset
construction erases thread identity; no execution point knows a capture,
and `(a*)b\1`'s state would need unbounded text — the pumping-lemma
classic). But when the referenced group's language is FINITE, the backref
is REGULAR and compiles away statically: `(abc)\1` is `abcabc`, `(a|b)\1`
is `aa|bb` — expand each choice with the reference synchronized, pure
DFA, zero runtime cost, and only an ahead-of-time compiler can afford the
expansion (bounded by the existing NFA/DFA caps and gcc-compile-time
budgets; infinite-language groups keep the VM). So the module's engine
answer is per-PATTERN, not per-row: finite-group backrefs → ENGM_DFA via
expansion, infinite-group → ENGM_VM. The `engines` column stays design
intent until then (nothing consumes it before SR-8/M4); do not read the
rows' VM_ONLY as a measured limit.

**SAME-SESSION COMPANION NOTE for `atomic-groups`/possessives (Frank):
the (?> row's VM_ONLY splits the same way, and the naive intuition is
BACKWARDS twice over.** A DFA never backtracks in the first place —
subset construction keeps every alternative alive, which is exactly the
NON-possessive semantics — so `a*+` is not a free annotation: it CHANGES
the language (`a*+ab` matches nothing, `a*ab` matches "aab"), and a
naively-determinized atomic group silently implements the wrong one.
But the language stays REGULAR (atomic/possessive are CUT operators;
Berglund et al., "Cuts in Regular Expressions" — cuts preserve
regularity with possibly-exponential conversion), so pure-DFA
compilation is achievable, and the construction's one primitive —
determine the sub-expression's OWN priority-first match endpoint online,
ignoring the continuation — is precisely the priority accept-pruning
pcrec's subset construction is already built around. Blowup bounded by
the existing caps; the disjoint-follow special case (PCRE2's own
auto-possessification direction, a*b ≡ a*+b when nothing that follows
can start with an `a`) is free in both directions. Engine answer again
per-PATTERN: cut-constructible → ENGM_DFA, else VM.

## M5 — UTF-8

- [M5.0] STATE:not-started — milestone (expand on arrival): byte-wise UTF-8 automata, \p{...} module

## M6 — PCRE feature modules

- [M6.0] STATE:not-started — milestone (expand on arrival): classes+ (\d \w \s, POSIX classes), assertions (\b \A \z, mid-pattern $), modifiers, lookaround, backrefs, atomic groups

(2026-08-13: the classes+ and modifiers halves already landed as gated
modules — MOD-0.3 and MOD-0.5, see docs/dev/plan_completed.md. Remaining:
assertions (VM-independent), lookaround, backrefs, atomic groups,
named-groups, conditionals, recursion producers.)

## M3 — Streaming input

- [M3.0] STATE:not-started — DESIGN GATE FIRST (R2-A3): D7's "same shape streaming needs" holds only for match-END finding. The reverse pass rescans backward through raw bytes a stream may no longer hold (unbounded for `.*` shapes). Design match-START finding under bounded memory BEFORE writing streaming code; reconcile with APPROACH §6's PARTIAL/WINDOW_EXCEEDED contract
- [M3.1] STATE:not-started — *_stream_* API for the DFA engine, chunk-boundary tests

(2026-08-13: moved after M6 per the Development order above — the streaming
API is designed once against the final engine+feature set; [DD-3] rides
along, [OS-3] feeds the design gate.)

## M7 — Hardening

- [M7.0] STATE:not-started — milestone (expand on arrival): differential fuzzing vs libpcre2, freestanding/embedded build profile, PCRE2 testdata import

## Beyond M7 — long-term vision (Frank, 2026-08-09)

Direction, not scheduled work. Recorded so the architecture is not painted into
a corner that would make these expensive later. Each becomes a milestone only
after the current ladder is complete and the result is something we are happy
with.

- [V-A] STATE:not-started — PCRE2 compatibility layer: a drop-in surface for callers who already speak PCRE2, so adopting pcrec does not mean rewriting call sites. Interacts with DD-3 (generated-API versioning) — a compat layer is a second consumer of the generated contract. TWO surfaces (Frank, 2026-08-12): the PCRE2-native API, and a POSIX `regex.h` shim (regcomp/regexec/regfree, à la pcre2posix) — a smaller surface with wider adoption reach, since decades of C code speaks regex.h and never touched PCRE2
- [V-B] STATE:not-started — usage libraries for other languages: bindings over the generated C. Note the generated code already has no runtime dependency on pcrec, which is what makes this cheap; keep it that way
- [V-C] STATE:not-started — a grep CLI built on pcrec, the natural end-user demonstration that the speed mandate (D18) actually shows up in a real tool
- [V-D] STATE:not-started — translators from other regex syntaxes into the base tier: grep/egrep (BRE/ERE), python `re`, and PCRE2-flavour differences. Pairs with V-C (a grep CLI needs BRE/ERE) and with V-A. Design note: these are FRONT-END modules that lower into the existing AST, exactly the shape APPROACH §3's parser extension points already anticipate — no engine work, which is what makes the direction affordable
- [V-E] STATE:not-started — MULTI-PATTERN COMPILATION UNITS and the
  CROSS-PATTERN FINDER (Frank, 2026-08-12; boonies tier by his word —
  recorded now, built with a customer). N named regexes into ONE emitted
  file: per-pattern named entry points exactly as today (a statically-known
  caller pays no dispatch — D20's rule holds), SHARED DATA deduplicated by
  CONTENT (the driver is M5: a dozen patterns each carrying a private copy
  of the unicode tables adds up; share by content hash, so sharing is only
  ever dedup of identical bytes and never forces a pattern's specialized
  table into a common shape), and OS-0's finder generalized by ONE AXIS:
  D20's selector already dispatches over option-combinations of one
  pattern; the same interface selects the PATTERN too. **This is OS-0's
  candidate FIRST CUSTOMER** — the finder was deferred for lack of one.
  D20's two structural properties still bind: dispatch resolves once per
  call and never reaches the hot loop; a single-pattern single-option
  request emits byte-for-byte today's output. Usage modes to design BEFORE
  building (Frank: "we should think about how it's used"): CLI
  multi-pattern args with per-pattern names, and a manifest file for build
  integration ([V-F] is the third consumer)
- [V-F] STATE:not-started — the SOURCE-SCAN TRANSFORMER (Frank, 2026-08-12,
  same discussion, same tier): scan a C program's sources for regex
  markers — `auto regex = rx/abc|def/` shaped — and rewrite them to
  references into a pcrec-compiled companion unit ([V-E]'s output format is
  the natural target). re2c/lex-shaped build tool. The dogfooding
  constraint IS the design constraint (Frank: the scanner uses a regex we
  compiled): the marker grammar must be REGULAR and unambiguous amid C
  strings/comments — chosen to be findable by the tool being sold, which
  makes the scanner both the demo and the spec. Do not start without a
  marker-grammar design note answering: escaping inside `rx/.../`, flags
  syntax, occurrences inside string literals and comments (skip or honor,
  and how a regular scanner distinguishes them)

M4-hosted, boonies-queued (Frank's queue discipline places these after the
spine, not before):

- [M4-CALLOUTS] STATE:not-started — module `callouts` (D36: Frank re-scoped
  `(?C` from NEVER to PLANNED, 2026-08-12 — LOW PRIORITY, deliberately in
  the queue boonies). Two separable steps: (1) THE FLIP, schedulable any
  time a lane is free: registry `(?C` row ROADMAP_NEVER → PLANNED, the
  diagnostic moves from "no module will implement" to "requires module
  'callouts'", reject + case11 pins move with it failing-first (NOTE,
  mod08fix lane 2026-08-12: case11 asserts `(?C1)` `roadmap never`,
  `names —`, and the "no module will implement it" status — load-bearing
  against today's tree; they MUST move inside the flip commit or the flip
  lands red), compliance
  prose updated IN THE SAME CHANGE (the K14 prose⇔column check binds them),
  and note the ROADMAP_NEVER live population drops to zero — the never
  branch stays, column-derived, covered the day a second row exists.
  (2) THE BEHAVIOR, M4-hosted and engine-forcing (VM only — the compiled
  DFA erases the pattern positions a callout fires at): static extern
  binding (`extern int rx_callout_n(const rx_callout_block *)` defined by
  the embedding program — compile-time binding, zero cost when absent;
  V-A's compat layer later implements pcre2_set_callout as a trampoline ON
  TOP of this primitive, not instead of it), callback block and return
  semantics (0/positive/negative) mirroring pcre2_callout_block exactly
  (D26-exact tier), fire-point discipline DOCUMENTED as engine-relative
  with PCRE2's own PCRE2_NO_START_OPTIMIZE latitude as the cited precedent
- [M4-SUBST] STATE:not-started — COMPILED SUBSTITUTION (Frank, 2026-08-12:
  the headline xmas item): the `pcre2_substitute` capability as an AOT
  artifact — pattern AND replacement template compiled together into one
  emitted C function (match + splice), first/global modes, caller-buffer
  zero-allocation mode plus an output-sizing mode. **The template compiler
  is almost completely independent of the matcher (Frank's observation,
  recorded because it sequences the work): it consumes only the
  capture-offset CONTRACT, so its design note can precede M4 even though
  end-to-end substitution is capture-gated.** AOT-only win to preserve in
  the design: `$n`/`${name}` references are resolved and BOUNDS-CHECKED AT
  COMPILE TIME against the pattern's own group count — a template naming a
  group that does not exist is a compile error, where PCRE2 discovers it at
  substitute time. Tier the template language: core `$n`/`${name}`/literal
  escapes first; PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_EXTENDED forms (\u \l case forcing,
  ${n:-default}, ${n:+yes:no}) earn their rows separately under D18's
  earn-its-axis discipline

## Design-debt ledger (from R1; resolve before the milestone that hits each)

- [DD-2] STATE:not-started — VM engine match/step limits (with M4 design) (R1 A-8). DOWNGRADED by D22: adversarial patterns are out of scope, so this is a ROBUSTNESS feature (a pathological pattern should fail honestly rather than hang), NOT a security boundary, and it must not be designed as one or traded against execution speed
- [DD-7] STATE:not-started — engine unification ownership (R2-A6): D7 promises ENG_UNANCH eventually absorbs `^`/`$` but no milestone owns it; M4 must also decide WHICH machine becomes the capture prefilter now that the engines forked; DD-4 (\G) must note `nfa_wrap_unanchored` bakes in the self-loop with no toggle
- [DD-9] STATE:not-started — case (f) `[01]*1[01]{8}` dense/counting patterns: still a ~6x loss to PCRE2-interp and NO MILESTONE OWNS IT (R3 critic). M2.10 attempted it and produced a negative result; plan and review both say "an M4 concern" but [M4.0] never mentions it. Decide with the M4 hybrid-engine design whether the DFA-prefilter/VM split covers it, and note that the D13 correction makes computed goto a MEASURED win for predictable transition sequences
- [DD-8] STATE:not-started — `--emit-ir` / `--emit-dot` promised in APPROACH §6, never built (R2-A7)
- [DD-1] STATE:not-started — case-insensitivity design: UNICODE folding vs byte-wise automata (before M5) (R1 A-7). The ASCII half is CLOSED by OS-1/D23 — it folded into class construction and is a parser change, not an engine question. What remains here is genuinely Unicode: multi-byte fold pairs, one-to-many foldings and the fold-before-negate rule over byte-range trees rather than a 256-bit bitmap
- [DD-12] STATE:not-started — the UTF ARCHITECTURE sketch (Frank,
  2026-08-12 tenth-session close; elaborates APPROACH §4/§10, OS-2, DD-1,
  D33 §7 into one position). (1) ONE parser, no encoding parameter in the
  grammar: the parser's semantic output becomes a CharSet — sorted CODE
  POINT intervals (the D33 §7 widening and DD-1's "byte-range trees" are
  this) — and the encoding is a LOWERING instance, CharSet → byte-level
  NFA fragment: ASCII = identity byte map, UTF-8 = interval-to-byte-
  sequence expansion with suffix sharing (the RE2/Ragel construction, so
  \p{L}-sized sets stay near-linear). Downstream (subset construction,
  minimization, emitter, prefilters) stays encoding-blind and BYTE-WISE —
  OS-2's fold prediction, made concrete. Parser changes only where UTF
  changes the LANGUAGE: \x{>FF} becomes meaningful, a multi-byte atom
  quantifies as one unit (free once atoms are lowered fragments), pattern
  validity. (2) UTF-8 AT MATCH TIME, ALWAYS — never convert the subject:
  UTF-32 conversion costs a decode pass + 4x memory, kills the byte
  prefilters/skips, breaks the byte-offset API (PCRE2 reports byte offsets
  even under UTF) and M3 streaming. Code points exist ONLY at regex-compile
  time, inside the CharSet, between parse and lowering — that is the right
  home for the "convert to UTF-32" instinct. The backtracking worry is
  bounded: the DFA never backtracks; the M4 VM steps back a character by
  skipping ≤3 continuation bytes (self-synchronization), O(1). (3) Invalid
  UTF-8 is a DECISION: byte-wise automata naturally treat invalid
  sequences as nomatch; PCRE2_UTF errors, but PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF is
  essentially the byte-wise semantics — measure against THAT mode and pick
  deliberately. (4) The oracle pipeline extends with a UTF twin of PC-4
  (compiled PCRE2_UTF), carrying the R13/R14 warning verbatim: a UTF sweep
  needs generators that can PRODUCE multi-byte constructs, or it counts
  the generator. (5) Fold-before-negate and the one-constructor-owns-fold
  seam (OS-1) carry over at the CharSet level; DD-1's Unicode fold pairs
  land there. (6) Scope: ASCII + UTF-8 only (D18 earn-its-axis; UTF-16's
  surrogates make byte automata messy and no consumer asks); encoding is
  a generation-time scalar (D20, --encoding), named entry points via OS-0
  if anyone wants both from one binary. Owners: the CharSet widening is
  MOD-0.6's (D33 §7); the lowering instances and the UTF PC-4 twin are
  M5's; DD-1 folds in at the CharSet level
- [DD-4] STATE:not-started — \G / global-iteration semantics vs startpos (with M6) (R1 A-11)
- [DD-6] STATE:not-started — multiline ^/$ as DFA state context — interacts with state budget (with assertions module) (R1 A-6)
- [DD-11] STATE:not-started — the NEWLINE CONVENTION axis (Frank,
  2026-08-12 tenth-session close). pcrec is NEWLINE_LF today and that is
  ANCHORED, not assumed: every oracle measurement runs libpcre2 at
  options=0 (build default LF on this box), so \N's generated bitmap is
  the measured complement of {0x0A}, `.` is every-byte-but-0x0A, and `$`
  is before-final-\n; a convention change on either side fails PC-4 and
  the census probe loudly. PCRE2 makes newline a per-pattern CONVENTION
  (CR/LF/CRLF/ANYCRLF/ANY/NUL via the start-only (*CR)-family verbs or the
  API option; \R separately via BSR) — pcrec refuses the verbs cleanly
  today (Q1 tables, start-only), so the axis is closed off LOUDLY, no
  miscompile. COST PREDICTION when a consumer arrives (D18 earn-its-axis):
  `.`/\N fold into the front end per-convention like OS-1's caseless
  (byte-set swap, oracle-generated tables, zero engine cost) for CR/LF/
  NUL/ANYCRLF/ANY; the ENGINE work is `$` (and DD-6's multiline ^/$) —
  an EOL assertion that becomes set-valued under ANY/ANYCRLF and a
  TWO-BYTE SEQUENCE under CRLF, in both the forward and reverse DFAs
  (the M2.7/M2.12 EOL-variant machinery is single-byte shaped), and
  CRLF also complicates `.`'s complement. Decide with the assertions
  module or a real consumer, whichever asks first; measure the
  convention's effect on the censuses through the existing probe
  pipeline before writing any table
- [DD-3] STATE:not-started — generated-API versioning/compat policy for vendored consumers (before M3) (R1 A-10)
- [DD-5] STATE:not-started — --std-c portable emitter fallback (switch-based) (R1 R-5)
- [DD-10] STATE:not-started — remaining unbounded C-stack recursion in the compiler (R3 critic, critic-perf): trie_build now has an explicit 256-frame/68 KB budget, but compile_ast and clo_visit's t1 edge are still bounded only by pattern structure. A 400-nested-branch-point alternation needs ~192 KB — fine on an 8 MB main thread, not on a musl 128 KB one, and pcrec is a library. Convert clo_visit to an explicit worklist and give compile_ast a stated budget, then the NFA cap can be derived from memory alone

## Option-specialization dimensions (D18) — each must EARN its engine

The caller names a SET of values per dimension and the product is over those
sets (D18). A singleton set is fully specialized and compiled away — asking for
case-insensitive ONLY is hyperspecialization, not an axis. A dimension is an
axis only when its set has 2+ elements. Each dimension below is a candidate for
that case; before it becomes an axis, measure whether specializing buys
anything, since a dimension that folds into the front end, is free at run time,
or is a pure wrapper is NOT an axis even when the caller names it plural. Predictions are in D18 — record the measurement against
the prediction, including when the prediction was wrong.

- [OS-0] STATE:not-started — the optional ENGINE FINDER module (D20). Given the SETS, drive the engine generator once per point of the product and emit the selector over the results. Its set-valued request surface lives HERE, not in `pcrec_options` — D20 deletes the API-change half of this step, because a generator that only ever compiles one point is correctly served by scalars. Two properties from D18 to preserve and to test structurally: dispatch resolves ONCE per search call and never reaches the hot loop, and a request with no plural dimension emits byte-for-byte what pcrec emits today (no dispatcher, no extra parameter, no indirection). Emit named per-combination entry points (`rx_search_ci_utf8`) as well as the selector, so a statically-known caller pays no dispatch at all. DEFERRED BY DESIGN: build this only once a dimension has actually survived D18's earn-its-axis test with a measurement behind it — if the OS-1/OS-2 predictions hold, it has no customer yet, and that is a good outcome rather than a stalled one
- [OS-2] STATE:not-started — encoding ascii/utf8: PREDICTED to fold, since APPROACH §4/§10 already commit to byte-wise UTF-8 automata with no hot-path decode, explicitly so ASCII and UTF-8 share one DFA emitter. Measure when M5 lands: is the emitted hot loop byte-identical in SHAPE between the two encodings for an equivalent pattern? If yes the axis collapses; if the UTF-8 path needs its own loop, that is a real axis and a surprise worth recording
- [OS-3] STATE:not-started — streaming: PREDICTED NOT to be a wrapper, and this is the one prediction with evidence already against the optimistic answer — the reverse pass rescans backward over bytes a stream may no longer hold. Feeds M3.0's design gate; do not write streaming code before it is settled
- [OS-4] STATE:not-started — anchoring: ENG_UNANCH vs ENG_ATTEMPT is ALREADY a cartesian split, and it has never passed this test. It exists because the reverse machine cannot check `^` at pp == 0, not because a per-start attempt loop was measured to be faster. Measure the cost of the split on the known-slow shape (`^` on only some branches, D8) and decide whether to close it by building the reverse BOT variant (DD-7) or to keep it with a number attached. An unjustified axis in the shipped compiler is the strongest possible test case for D18's own rule

## Parser structure — the syntax construct registry (D24)

**THE AGREED ORDER (R6, 2026-08-10) is COMPLETE — the FIX-1 / PC-3+Q1 / FIX-2 /
Q2+SR-9 / MOD-0 / DOC-1 / PC-4 arc it sequenced is done and archived in
docs/dev/plan_completed.md.** Work these in sequence. Each is a
checkpoint: critic panel (D6), journal entry, plan STATE update, touched
CLAUDE.md files, commit, push.

Sequenced so each step pays for itself before the next is justified. SR-1/SR-2
collapse a duplication that has already produced one shipped bug; everything
after waits for a forcing function. Frank's priority stands throughout: the
95% path stays fast and simple, and exotic constructs earn only the right to be
named, cleanly rejected and queried.

- [SR-5] STATE:not-started — guard the fast path CLAIM, do not just assert it.
  REWRITE THE ASSERTION FIRST (R6): the claim as written here — "base-tier
  patterns must perform ZERO registry lookups (`(?:` excepted)" — is FALSE in
  both directions, measured with an instrumented build on 2026-08-10. `(?:`
  performs zero (parse.c answers it before the registry), while `[abc]` performs
  one and `[a-z]+@[a-z]+\.[a-z]{2,4}` performs three, because the class-bracket
  doorway is on the base-tier path. Written as specified, SR-5 would fail the
  moment it was built, or would have to assert something untrue. The property
  actually worth guarding is a BOUND: lookups <= one per non-negated `[` plus
  one per `[` inside a class, and zero for a pattern with no character class. Use
  an instrumented build with a lookup counter, the way run_trie_identity.sh
  uses `-DPCREC_NO_TRIE`, so no counter exists in the shipped build (TS-1 would
  reject one anyway). Pair with the M2.9 compile-time budgets
- [SR-6] STATE:not-started — MODULE HANDLERS move to their own module TUs as
  each module lands (as-built naming: src/parse/mod_*.c flat in src/parse/ —
  mod_modifiers.c, mod_verbs.c — not the src/parse/ext/*.c subdirectory this
  row originally predicted; R18 docs critic. The verbs entry below remains
  accurately PENDING: MOD-0.4 moved the doorway/tables to mod_verbs.c but no
  verb produces yet, so SR-6's real per-verb handler has not landed)
  (esc_class, esc_assert, esc_backref, esc_uniprop, esc_misc,
  grp_lookaround, grp_named, grp_atomic, grp_cond, grp_recurse, grp_modifier,
  grp_callout, verbs, cls_posix). Not a step to schedule — a rule to follow
  when a module is implemented. NOTE (R4 critic finding): the row does NOT yet
  name a handler — that field arrives with SR-2 — and the status vocabulary has
  no value meaning "implemented by module X"; RS_MODULE unconditionally implies
  rejection today. SR-6 therefore carries an unwritten schema change, not just a
  file move
- [SR-7] STATE:deferred — FLAVOURS (families as named masks: `pcre2-10.46`,
  `pcre2-dfa`, `python-re`, `ere`). Deferred by D18's earn-its-axis rule
  applied to the front end: exactly ONE flavour-varying row is known (`\v`), so
  the selection machinery has a set of size one and no customer. The column
  exists from SR-1; it turns on when a second flavour earns it. Note
  `pcre2-dfa` is the ENGINE-capability axis expressed as a family, so this step
  and DD-7/M4 are related. BLOCKER TO PLAN FOR (R4 critic finding):
  `pcrec_registry_find(kind, sel)` takes no flavour argument and returns the
  first row matching a byte, so SR-1's "short chain for the rare flavour-varying
  byte" is not expressible in the shipped shape — SR-7 must change that
  signature. Today a duplicate selector is caught loudly by tests/registry/
  rather than silently shadowing, so this is a design debt, not a live bug
- [SR-8] STATE:deferred — ENGINE-capability check moves OUT of the parser.
  Today `\1` is rejected by the PARSER as "requires module 'backrefs'", but
  backrefs parse fine and simply cannot LOWER to a DFA. When M4's VM exists the
  honest diagnostic becomes "requires the VM engine", which is a lowering-time
  check against the registry's `engines` column. Blocked on M4 having a second
  engine to choose between
- [SR-10] STATE:not-started — SINGLE NAMESPACE DEFINITIONS (Frank,
  2026-08-12: "do we have a single set of 'modules' or 'encodings'? we
  should, and then those should be directly referenced — this enforces
  existence over everyone using string names"). One authoritative table per
  namespace — MODULES, ENCODINGS, (post-D37) NAMED FEATURE SETS, and
  flavours when SR-7 lands — with every renderer and parser of a namespace
  member referencing the table entry (enum/identifier + its one string),
  never a loose literal. Existence becomes a compile-time property: a
  diagnostic cannot name a nonexistent member because the name is not
  reachable except through the table. The both-directions checks then guard
  table⇔docs instead of table⇔scattered-strings. MOTIVATING INSTANCE
  (R20/0.8c): src/core/compile.c:97 hand-wrote "requires module 'utf8'" —
  a member of no namespace — while cli/main.c separately hand-mapped
  "utf8"→PCREC_ENC_UTF8; slice 3's reword fixes the instance, THIS row
  fixes the class. Audit inventory at start: every `module '` /
  `--features` / `-e` string site, the enabled.c parser, the registry
  module column, compile.c's encoding gate
- [DOC-BM] STATE:deferred — **the bound-mode document** (design §18.5):
  full 32-bit option sweep with seeded generators, the `RS_NOT_OFFERED`
  split, the `EXTRA_BAD_ESCAPE_IS_LITERAL` 18-cell migration. Constraint:
  must exist BEFORE §7.1's five escape rows land (their `status` values are
  its output; A1's pins hold the surface meanwhile).

  ~~STATE:blocked (2026-08-11 — the R11 design panel refuted parts of
  D30, exactly as R10 refuted D29, and the resolution is Frank's call.** See
  `docs/dev/reviews/2026-08-11-r11-parse1-mod01.md` and D30's inline R11 marks.
  NOTHING WAS BUILT; the panel ran against a written design and every finding
  cost a paragraph rather than a commit. **Seven dispositions** are listed at the
  end of R11 and they are the specification for the re-resolution, which wants a
  D32 the way D30 answered R10. The three that change the most work: (1) D30
  §2's non-optional check is FALSE as written — "promise a module wherever
  libpcre2 DISPATCHES" has 93 counterexamples in 1,672 probes and ALL 93 are
  pcrec being CORRECT, because "dispatched" does not imply a module is owed;
  (2) rank is almost entirely UNCHECKED — 20 of 22 rows accept any value to 250,
  the single prefix pair is a THRESHOLD not an ordering, and two of D30's three
  required checks fire on identical boundaries in all 5,632 probes, so one of
  them adds nothing; (3) the returning-doorway defect PARSE-1 handed over is
  FOUR call sites across three doorways, and `pcrec_ext_escape`'s pair is
  UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR — making it return makes `build/pcrec` itself SIGSEGV on
  `[a\qb]` while `a\qb` silently launders the pointer out of `%rax`. Of the
  group-discard class, 7 of 18 generated patterns are byte-identical to a
  SMALLER pattern and 0 of 18 behave as the contract promises.
  Measured facts that survive and should be reused: 100 rows / 18 tails /
  exactly 4 multi-row buckets holding all 18 tailed rows = 22 rows (D30's own
  figure, independently derived); D30's undocumented 0/25/40/70 rank mapping
  recovered and verified 22/22 two ways; `ext.c` never reads `.tail` so its six
  call sites need no change; **[RETRACTED — see R11's addendum: `find()`'s
  same-length tie-break is UNREACHABLE, because it needs an identical
  `(sel,tail)` pair which `registry_check.c:184-193` already forbids, and rank
  would NOT make it loud — two duplicate rows at ranks 25 vs 26 resolve
  silently]**; and existing
  external coverage of tailed rows is 2 prefixes, not the 10,200 probes it
  looks like) — the interface, as D30
  resolves it. **DECLARED RANK**: a row carries an integer rank; every
  recogniser in the bucket runs; the highest-ranked ANSWERING row wins; two
  answering rows at EQUAL rank is the defect. Rank is DATA, so no recogniser
  needs to know its siblings and the bare fallback answering "always" at rank 0
  is correct rather than naive. The doorway's answer is **not an enum** but
  three facts — (dispatched?, compiles?, whose message?) — so that `(*MARK)`'s
  "CLAIM the construct, name NO module" has a cell. Plus `tail_default` and its
  row parameter, and bucket dispatch. THREE checks, and all three are required:
  (a) the **per-row `syntax` check** (C4-6) — a row's own `syntax`, fed to its
  bucket, must be won by THAT row and no other; it is TOTAL over 22 rows, needs
  no generated space and no oracle, and it is the primary instrument; (b) the
  **rank sweep** with `check_tail_precedence`'s **LIVENESS CLAUSE CARRIED OVER**
  — measured, inverting the one prefix-related pair is observable on exactly ONE
  input in 176,544, so a sweep that asserts nothing must SAY so rather than
  print a PASS; (c) the **reachability differential** against libpcre2 — *pcrec
  must promise a module wherever libpcre2 DISPATCHES* — which is the only thing
  that covers the malformed-body class and is NOT optional. Prototyped and
  sabotaged before adoption; see D30 §1-2 for the numbers

## Optimization waves (D21) — algorithmic, then profiled code, then compile time

Not a milestone: a shape applied at appropriate points, in this ORDER. Profiling
a bad algorithm optimizes the wrong loop, and optimizing compile time before
execution speed trades the primary goal (D18) for the secondary one.

- (Frank, 2026-08-12, on this whole block: "this project's greatest benefit
  will be its testing suite. builds confidence and lets us go crazy when we
  get to optimizations" — suite strength is the PREREQUISITE INVESTMENT for
  everything below; an optimization the suite cannot referee does not land)
- [OPT-A] STATE:not-started — ALGORITHMIC search optimization, and research is part of the work: pcrec is open source and pulling from other open-source engines is the point. Survey before hand-tuning. Leads recorded in D21: rare-byte prefilter selection (ripgrep/Hyperscan choose the RAREST byte by frequency; we choose memchr only at exactly one escape byte and otherwise fall to a bitmap — this attacks our case (d) path directly), memchr2/memchr3 for the 2-3 escape-byte gap, multi-byte literal search (Two-Way/Boyer-Moore/memmem) instead of scan-to-a-byte-then-step, Teddy/SIMD multi-pattern prefilter for the keyword-alternation shape M2.8 targets, reverse-inner and suffix literal selection when the prefix is weak, shift-or/bitap for short patterns, and transition-table compression (we do alphabet compression via byte equivalence classes but no table packing). Record rejections with the reason — "Teddy does not fit because X" is worth as much as adopting it
- [OPT-B] STATE:not-started — PROFILED code-level optimization, only after OPT-A. D13's correction says throughput here is dominated by transition PREDICTABILITY, so target branch behaviour and memory layout rather than instruction count. Every number under D12's rules and the R3.10 load guard
- [OPT-C] STATE:not-started — COMPILE-TIME optimization, last. Must include what gcc does with our output, not only what pcrec does: after M2.8, gcc is the LARGER half (0.79 s vs 1.36 s at 3600 words) and M2.9's budgets measure only pcrec's

## Thread-safety (D19) — usable FROM threads; guards, not prose

Audited 2026-08-09: generated code and the library are BOTH thread-safe today
(every emitted static is const, no file-scope mutable state anywhere in src/,
Ctx and its jmp_buf are locals of pcrec_compile). These steps exist to keep
that true, because it is invisible to every current test and a one-line change
can destroy it.

- [TS-4] STATE:not-started — DD-10 is a thread-safety item, not just robustness (D19): musl's default THREAD stack is 128 KB against the main thread's 8 MB, and `compile_ast` plus `clo_visit`'s t1 edge are still bounded only by pattern structure (~192 KB for 400 nested branch points). Give `compile_ast` a stated budget the way trie_build has one, and add a `tests/cli` stack case that binds it — case 8 covers branch COUNT, nothing covers nesting DEPTH

## Process mechanization (session 2026-08-09) — turn recurring lessons into tools

Four consecutive checkpoints have found the same failure class: not compiler
defects, but measurement claims about safeguards that were stale, contaminated,
or never made. Writing the lesson down demonstrably does not install it (this
session restated a load-contamination rule and violated it in the same
document). Mechanize instead.

- [MECH-3] STATE:not-started — a measurement wrapper that refuses to emit a number without provenance: interleaved A/B, N trials, load before AND after (R3.10), min/median/max spread, and a stamped record. Every performance overclaim this project has made — the 27%-recorded-as-+40%, this session's 1.5-4.1% deltas taken at load 4.5-9.7 — would have been blocked at the point of measurement rather than caught in review. Frank's precedent: a claude-safe grep that refuses `| tail` and reports what it actually looked at

## PCRE2 compliance tracking

- [PC-2] STATE:not-started — periodic re-survey: re-read pcre2syntax.html,
  re-run tests/reject, move landed modules from REJECTED to OK, re-stamp the
  date. Do this whenever a module lands and at each checkpoint review

## Small-debt shelf (light-session filler; pointers, not new rows)

Pointers, not queue positions — states live on the real rows cited.

- K9 — the public API takes no pattern length, so a pattern containing NUL
  compiles as its prefix; fix before any V-tier consumer exists
  (docs/dev/known_issues.md).
- TS-4 / DD-10 — stack budgets for `compile_ast` and `clo_visit`'s t1 edge.
- DD-8 — `--emit-ir` / `--emit-dot`, useful during M4 bring-up.
- SR-5 — guard the fast-path lookup-count claim with an instrumented build.
- MECH-3 — schedule before [OPT-A] opens.
- module-swap / row-deletion guard — owed, unruled.
- PC-4 missing shapes — caseless-negated, `\N{n,m}`, MODIFIER, zero-tail
  `(?P`.
- M4-CALLOUTS step 1 — the registry flip to PLANNED; schedulable any free
  lane.
- PC-2 — re-survey.
