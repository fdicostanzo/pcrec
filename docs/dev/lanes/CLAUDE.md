# docs/dev/lanes/ — per-lane restart records and delivery reports

One `<lane>_log.md` (the lane's own running log: what it did, in order,
for its restart) and one `<lane>_report.md` (the delivery: commits, the
brief's acceptance table filled with MEASURED values, findings) per lane
that chose to keep them. Optional — briefs allow it, never require it.
They are the lane's voice, not the manager's: the plan, journal and
decisions log carry the manager's record, and on any disagreement the
committed docs in docs/dev/ win. Historical once the lane is merged;
never edited afterwards.

- `w11_log.md`, `w11_report.md` — [DD-13b.W1.1] (2026-08-30, lane w11):
  the .rxt HEAD grammar, `--list-source`, the three-parser identity proof
  C1, the wiring of verify_rxt.py (C3), sabotage rows S194-S204.
- `w11f_report.md` — the r46 fix lane (2026-08-30, lane w11f): the panel's
  triage on the [DD-13b.W1.1] merge (`docs/dev/reviews/
  2026-08-30-r46-w11-impl.md`) fixed finding by finding — the BLOCKER
  (leg B's escape emitting a table index instead of a byte's value), 8
  must-fix + 2 chk must-fix + sem24/32, most of the shoulds each with a
  new `.rxtin` fixture, and the manager's sem10 ruling (a blank line ends
  a `config` body exactly as it ends a block scalar). New sabotage row
  `S205`.
