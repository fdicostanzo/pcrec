# pcrec Project Plan

Working plan derived from ../APPROACH.md. Milestones M0–M7 mirror APPROACH §9.

## Step-state format (grep'able)

Every step line matches exactly:

    - [Mx.y] STATE:<state> — <title>

States: `not-started` | `started` | `completed` | `blocked` | `deferred`

Find work:

    grep -n "STATE:started" docs/plan.md
    grep -n "STATE:not-started" docs/plan.md
    grep -c "STATE:completed" docs/plan.md

Rules: update the STATE tag in place when a step changes state; expand a milestone
into substeps only when work on it begins (replace its single `[Mx.0]` line);
note blockers inline after the title with `(blocked: reason)`.

## M0 — Scaffold & process

- [M0.1] STATE:completed — directory layout, GNU Makefile
- [M0.2] STATE:completed — docs: plan.md, dev_journal.md, decisions.md
- [M0.3] STATE:completed — CLAUDE.md in each directory
- [M0.4] STATE:completed — test harness: run.sh, driver.c, docs/testing.md (subagent)
- [M0.5] STATE:completed — base test corpus in tests/base/, python-re cross-verified (subagent)

## M1 — Base compiler end-to-end (ASCII, string source, DFA engine)

- [M1.1] STATE:completed — core utils: arena allocator, string buffer, error/longjmp diagnostics
- [M1.2] STATE:completed — AST + base parser (with module hook points for escapes and (?… groups)
- [M1.3] STATE:completed — NFA construction: priority Thompson with greedy/lazy split ordering
- [M1.4] STATE:completed — priority subset construction (leftmost-first via accept-pruning) + byte equivalence classes
- [M1.5] STATE:completed — codegen: computed-goto DFA, ASCII encoding, string-source search API
- [M1.6] STATE:completed — library API: pcrec_compile() in lib/pcrec.h
- [M1.7] STATE:completed — CLI: pcrec -p/-o/-e/--emit-main
- [M1.8] STATE:completed — integration: base corpus green under harness

Known M1 limitations (tracked for later milestones):
- ~~mid-pattern `$`~~ REMOVED by R1 fix: EOL-variant states make `$` fully general
  (single-line semantics; multiline stays with the assertions module).
- Unanchored search is a per-start-position attempt loop (measured O(n²), R1 A-2);
  M2.0's search-from-anywhere automaton is the fix.
- No DFA minimization yet (M2). Bounded repeats expand states (cap enforced); counter
  loops come with the VM engine (M4).
- Capturing groups parse but only the overall match span is reported (captures are M4).

## M2 — Optimizer & long-text performance (seeded by R1 findings)

- [M2.0] STATE:completed — DESIGN GATE (R1 A-2/A-3): adopt the search-from-anywhere self-loop automaton (kills O(n²), same shape M3 streaming needs) and the hybrid emitter (computed goto for small DFAs, table-driven for large); re-ground the state cap in measured gcc compile time
- [M2.1] STATE:completed — scan-avoidance: memchr/bitmap start prefilter, self-loop skip states (fwd+rev), anchored fast path (^-only patterns skip the start loop)
- [M2.2] STATE:completed — DFA minimization (Moore signature refinement, EOL-view as extra symbol); alternation-to-trie DEFERRED with rationale: subset construction already merges alternation prefixes in the final DFA, so a trie pass would only shrink the intermediate NFA (compile-speed win with no current budget pressure)
- [M2.3] STATE:completed — tests/bench: throughput budgets AND gcc-compile-time budgets on generated code as regression tests (R1 A-3)
- [M2.4] STATE:completed — coverage breadth (R1 P-M1/P-M2/P-N1/P-N2): CLI surface, library API direct, startpos != 0, long subjects, high bytes/NUL
- [M2.5] STATE:completed — PCRE2-oracle differential fuzzer committed to tests/ (pulled forward from M7; R1 lesson — semantics critic's libpcre2 binding)
- [M2.6] STATE:completed — K1 fix (landed early at R2: loop-entry empty-iteration rule; also fixed R2-S1 in BOTH engines)
- [M2.7] STATE:completed — engine unification for `$` (D8; `^` deferred, needs a reverse BOT variant) — engine unification (R2-A2, FATAL): `$`-without-`^` patterns route to ENG_ATTEMPT which has NO scan-avoidance and is still O(n²) — measured 14.3x slower on a log pattern, quadratic on `a*b$`. Either fold `^`/`$` into ENG_UNANCH (EOL-variant switching in fwd+rev, BOT handling in reverse) or give ENG_ATTEMPT prefilters. R1's A-2 is only half-fixed until this lands
- [M2.8] STATE:completed — NFA-level alternation trie (R2-A4, D9/D10): priority-preserving prefix trie in src/ir/nfa.c; the quadratic turned out to be closure FAN-OUT, not state count (measured 4045 visits/closure at 2000 branches, 2.36e9 total). 3600-word list: hard-fail -> 0.93 s. NFA cap re-derived 20000 -> 131072 so the emitter-grounded DFA caps bind first; clo_visit tail edges made iterative so the cap no longer depends on gcc's TCO. ALSO fixed an unrelated repo-fatal bug found on the way: `.gitignore`'s unanchored `core` had excluded src/core/ from every commit
- [M2.9] STATE:completed — benchmark rigor (R2-B3/B4, D12): taskset pinning (chrt probed, unprivileged here), governor/turbo/loadavg capture, BENCH_TRIALS repeats judged on the median with max/min spread printed, budgets re-derived as measured-median/1.75 and VALIDATED by sabotage (prefilter+skips disabled fails all 3; the old budgets would have passed all 3), case (c) subject made match-free so it measures a scan rather than early exit, linearity moved to 16/64 MB x20 iterations so it is no longer a timer artifact
- [M2.10] STATE:completed — dense/counting-pattern codegen (R2-A5, D13). Two results, one NEGATIVE and honestly so: (1) widening skip eligibility from ">=192 of 256 bytes" to a fraction of LIVE bytes so `[01]*1[01]{8}` qualifies MEASURED 27% SLOWER on that very case and was REVERTED — the +40% first recorded was a bad un-interleaved sample; a codegen check now asserts the state stays ineligible so it cannot be re-landed on plausibility. (2) D7's promised computed-goto-vs-table arbitration RESOLVED by micro-benchmark, with a correction: computed goto is 2.5x slower on data-dependent transitions but 3.5x FASTER on predictable ones, so the crossover is in PREDICTABILITY, not DFA size. The unconditional table emitter stands because general scanning is the data-dependent case. Case (f) itself remains a loss vs PCRE2 and is now an M4 concern
- [M2.11] STATE:completed — process ratchets (R2-PR7/PR8). tests/known_fail/run_known_fail.sh inverts the verdict on deferred-bug regressions (now-PASSING is flagged and fails, with promotion instructions); tests/bench/compare/gate.sh gates pcrec's own per-case headline numbers against a checked-in floors.tsv (absolute values, not cross-engine ratios, which move for reasons that are not our regression); compare.sh no longer silently overwrites a same-day snapshot. All three validated in both directions
- [M2.12] STATE:completed — restore prefilter/skip loops on the EOL engine path. The two emitters M2.7 forked are merged back into one EOL-aware emit_unanchored (the fork IS how the `$` path lost these for a milestone); skips bounded at n-1, memchr keeps no early return, reverse skip carries a pp+1<n entry guard. Also required moving the accept/EOL evaluation AFTER the skips — bounding alone is not enough, a skip landing on n-1 would consume that byte before its EOL view was taken. `$` throughput 291 -> 22248 MB/s median of 7 (~76x), now at parity with the same pattern without `$`. The reorder is applied ONLY when eol is set: doing it unconditionally shipped a 43% regression on `[01]*1[01]{8}` (158.4 -> 90.8 MB/s), found later the same day by the M2.11 compare gate. Non-`$` codegen is byte-identical to pre-M2.12 on 8 probe patterns — a claim that was made prematurely the first time and is now actually true

## M3 — Streaming input

- [M3.0] STATE:not-started — DESIGN GATE FIRST (R2-A3): D7's "same shape streaming needs" holds only for match-END finding. The reverse pass rescans backward through raw bytes a stream may no longer hold (unbounded for `.*` shapes). Design match-START finding under bounded memory BEFORE writing streaming code; reconcile with APPROACH §6's PARTIAL/WINDOW_EXCEEDED contract
- [M3.1] STATE:not-started — *_stream_* API for the DFA engine, chunk-boundary tests

## M4 — Captures + backtracking VM engine

- [M4.0] STATE:not-started — milestone (expand on arrival): VM emitter, DFA-prefilter hybrid, DFA islands

## M5 — UTF-8

- [M5.0] STATE:not-started — milestone (expand on arrival): byte-wise UTF-8 automata, \p{...} module

## M6 — PCRE feature modules

- [M6.0] STATE:not-started — milestone (expand on arrival): classes+ (\d \w \s, POSIX classes), assertions (\b \A \z, mid-pattern $), modifiers, lookaround, backrefs, atomic groups

## M7 — Hardening

- [M7.0] STATE:not-started — milestone (expand on arrival): differential fuzzing vs libpcre2, freestanding/embedded build profile, PCRE2 testdata import

## Checkpoint review gates (D6)

Every milestone ends with an adversarial critic-panel review of the work since
the last checkpoint; compiled results live in docs/reviews/.

- [R1] STATE:completed — M0+M1 checkpoint review (4 critics) — compiled + triaged in docs/reviews/2026-08-09-m1.md
- [R2] STATE:completed — M2 checkpoint review (5 critics; 4 reported, process/tests/docs critic did not deliver — lens carried to R3) — docs/reviews/2026-08-09-m2.md
- [R1.1] STATE:completed — all fix-now items applied and verified (2 wrong-answer bugs via EOL-variant states, 3 crash classes, leak class, LLP64 span type, PCRE accept/reject parity, harness integrity, CLI --); suite 353/353

## Design-debt ledger (from R1; resolve before the milestone that hits each)

- [DD-1] STATE:not-started — case-insensitivity design incl. Unicode folding vs byte-wise automata (before M5) (R1 A-7)
- [DD-2] STATE:not-started — VM engine match/step limits — ReDoS stance (with M4 design) (R1 A-8)
- [DD-3] STATE:not-started — generated-API versioning/compat policy for vendored consumers (before M3) (R1 A-10)
- [DD-4] STATE:not-started — \G / global-iteration semantics vs startpos (with M6) (R1 A-11)
- [DD-5] STATE:not-started — --std-c portable emitter fallback (switch-based) (R1 R-5)
- [DD-7] STATE:not-started — engine unification ownership (R2-A6): D7 promises ENG_UNANCH eventually absorbs `^`/`$` but no milestone owns it; M4 must also decide WHICH machine becomes the capture prefilter now that the engines forked; DD-4 (\G) must note `nfa_wrap_unanchored` bakes in the self-loop with no toggle
- [R3.3] STATE:completed — M2.8 IS structurally testable and the journal concluded the opposite (R3 semantics critic F4). Emitted C is byte-identical between the shipped build and a trie-disabled one (`elig[j] = false`) across 4722 patterns, and the check is cheap — a 500-pattern enumeration runs in 1.4 s with NO gcc, and flags 14/500 under the disjointness sabotage and 12/500 under the rule-1 sabotage, where the .rxt corpus catches the disjointness sabotage with 2 cases total. Add it as a codegen-level check; it is a far stronger net than subject sampling RESOLVED: tests/codegen/run_trie_identity.sh, wired into `make test` — 500 patterns byte-identical in ~4 s via a -DPCREC_NO_TRIE reference build, with THREE deterministic positive controls at 4, 8 and 256 branches (patterns whose NFA fits the cap only when factored) so the check cannot pass by both builds being unfactored. The first version had ONE control, at 256 branches, while every corpus pattern has 3..8 — a critic defeated it in one clause (`nbr >= 100 &&`), leaving the whole of `make test` green with the trie deleted for every hand-written pattern. The controls must fire INSIDE the corpus's own range. Sabotage-validated four ways, exact edits recorded in tests/codegen/CLAUDE.md: disjointness guard off 21/200 and 64/500; rule-1 accept split hoisted 38/200 and 94/500; trie off in the shipped build 0 differ, only the controls fire; `nbr >= 100` threshold 0 differ, the 4- and 8-branch controls fire. D16.
- [R3.4] STATE:completed — the D11 forward-side regression net has a hole (R3 semantics critic F3): none of the 13 patterns in tests/base/eol_scan_avoidance.rxt produces a forward skip state whose plain accept flag is set, so the FORWARD half of "scan avoidance before accept evaluation" — the half D11 is written about — has no committed case. The critic built 199 such patterns (`a.*|b$`, `=.*|x$`, `a[^\n]*|\n$` family) and all were correct; add one to the .rxt file RESOLVED: 6 patterns / 44 cases added, oracle-verified. The critic's suggested family was right but incomplete — the load-bearing case turned out to be the NON-EOL half: `[a-z].*|q$` compiles to a machine with no EOL variants at all (`[a-z].*` subsumes `q$`), and `a.*|b` / `=.*|;` carry no `$` so that coverage cannot evaporate. Sabotage-validated on both halves separately: EOL accept restricted to the boundary fails 3, non-EOL post-skip `last = pos` dropped fails 10, and the original 13 catch NEITHER. Also found: this file does not catch relaxing the EOL skip bound n-1 -> n either, despite its header — other tests/base files do (3 cases).
- [R3.5] STATE:completed — compare gate margin admits a 29% uniform regression (R3 claims critic F1): GATE_MARGIN=0.70 fires only below 1.43x, so M2.10's 27% case would NOT have been caught (only the 43% one was). Either tighten the margin with more BENCH_TRIALS, or gate per-case against a recorded spread rather than one global margin RESOLVED: per-case margins, floors.tsv gains a 4th column, margin = clamp(1/(spread*1.05), 0.70, 0.90) (D17). The CEILING is fixed rather than derived — the box noise floor is ~10% even at median-of-7 — and the floor keeps a noisy case no looser than the old default, so this is never a loss of strictness. Validated: a uniform 27% regression now fails 8 of 9 cases where it previously failed 0. Case (i) (latency, spread 2.04x) is the one that still cannot see it, and the gate now PRINTS its own weakest case every run instead of leaving that to be recomputed by a critic. Margins measured 2026-08-09 on a quiet box; floor VALUES deliberately not re-baselined (the run reproduced them within 2%).
- [DD-9] STATE:not-started — case (f) `[01]*1[01]{8}` dense/counting patterns: still a ~6x loss to PCRE2-interp and NO MILESTONE OWNS IT (R3 critic). M2.10 attempted it and produced a negative result; plan and review both say "an M4 concern" but [M4.0] never mentions it. Decide with the M4 hybrid-engine design whether the DFA-prefilter/VM split covers it, and note that the D13 correction makes computed goto a MEASURED win for predictable transition sequences
- [DD-10] STATE:not-started — remaining unbounded C-stack recursion in the compiler (R3 critic, critic-perf): trie_build now has an explicit 256-frame/68 KB budget, but compile_ast and clo_visit's t1 edge are still bounded only by pattern structure. A 400-nested-branch-point alternation needs ~192 KB — fine on an 8 MB main thread, not on a musl 128 KB one, and pcrec is a library. Convert clo_visit to an explicit worklist and give compile_ast a stated budget, then the NFA cap can be derived from memory alone
- [DD-8] STATE:not-started — `--emit-ir` / `--emit-dot` promised in APPROACH §6, never built (R2-A7)
- [DD-6] STATE:not-started — multiline ^/$ as DFA state context — interacts with state budget (with assertions module) (R1 A-6)

## Option-specialization dimensions (D18) — each must EARN its engine

"Open" means the CALLER explicitly asked for that option to stay variable at
run time (D18). Everything else is closed by default and compiled away, so the
common case is ONE engine. Each dimension below is a candidate axis for when
someone does open it. Before it becomes one, measure whether specializing buys
anything; a dimension that folds into the front end, is free at run time, or is
a pure wrapper is NOT an axis even when opened. Predictions are in D18 — record the measurement against
the prediction, including when the prediction was wrong.

- [OS-1] STATE:not-started — ASCII case-insensitivity: PREDICTED to fold entirely into class construction (`bitmap |= swapcase(bitmap)` at parse time), giving zero runtime cost, no second engine, and possibly SMALLER tables via byte-class merging. Measure: table size and throughput, folded vs a hypothetical runtime-checked variant, on a case-heavy pattern set. If the prediction holds, DD-1 stops being an engine question for the ASCII tier and becomes a parser change. Unicode folding is a separate question and stays with DD-1/M5
- [OS-2] STATE:not-started — encoding ascii/utf8: PREDICTED to fold, since APPROACH §4/§10 already commit to byte-wise UTF-8 automata with no hot-path decode, explicitly so ASCII and UTF-8 share one DFA emitter. Measure when M5 lands: is the emitted hot loop byte-identical in SHAPE between the two encodings for an equivalent pattern? If yes the axis collapses; if the UTF-8 path needs its own loop, that is a real axis and a surprise worth recording
- [OS-3] STATE:not-started — streaming: PREDICTED NOT to be a wrapper, and this is the one prediction with evidence already against the optimistic answer — the reverse pass rescans backward over bytes a stream may no longer hold. Feeds M3.0's design gate; do not write streaming code before it is settled
- [OS-4] STATE:not-started — anchoring: ENG_UNANCH vs ENG_ATTEMPT is ALREADY a cartesian split, and it has never passed this test. It exists because the reverse machine cannot check `^` at pp == 0, not because a per-start attempt loop was measured to be faster. Measure the cost of the split on the known-slow shape (`^` on only some branches, D8) and decide whether to close it by building the reverse BOT variant (DD-7) or to keep it with a number attached. An unjustified axis in the shipped compiler is the strongest possible test case for D18's own rule

## Process mechanization (session 2026-08-09) — turn recurring lessons into tools

Four consecutive checkpoints have found the same failure class: not compiler
defects, but measurement claims about safeguards that were stale, contaminated,
or never made. Writing the lesson down demonstrably does not install it (this
session restated a load-contamination rule and violated it in the same
document). Mechanize instead.

- [MECH-1] STATE:not-started — GENERATE the sabotage tables rather than hand-writing them. Every "disabling X fails N cases" figure in the docs is a hand-copied number that goes stale silently; this session shipped three wrong ones (a figure never measured, one from a tree with two sabotages stacked, and one whose sabotage form was UB so its count was unstable). Build a script that owns the sabotage edits, applies each to a pristine tree, verifies the edit actually applied, runs the suites, and prints the detection matrix. Docs then cite its output and drift becomes detectable by re-running it
- [MECH-2] STATE:not-started — a pristine-sabotage-tree helper. The contaminated 132/200 figure came from a hand-rolled copy+sed+`git checkout` loop where the revert silently failed (`|| true` inside a tarball copy that is not a git repo) so sabotage 2 landed on top of sabotage 1. One helper that makes a fresh tree per sabotage, asserts the target text was found and changed, and refuses to continue otherwise. Subsumed by MECH-1 if that lands first
- [MECH-3] STATE:not-started — a measurement wrapper that refuses to emit a number without provenance: interleaved A/B, N trials, load before AND after (R3.10), min/median/max spread, and a stamped record. Every performance overclaim this project has made — the 27%-recorded-as-+40%, this session's 1.5-4.1% deltas taken at load 4.5-9.7 — would have been blocked at the point of measurement rather than caught in review. Frank's precedent: a claude-safe grep that refuses `| tail` and reports what it actually looked at

## Post-M2 follow-ups (from checkpoint review R3, docs/reviews/2026-08-09-m2-close.md)

- [R3.1] STATE:completed — skip states have NO throughput guard anywhere (R3 critic, reframed): all four `make bench` patterns emit ZERO skip tables, so generated code is byte-identical with pick_skip_states returning 0 — bench cannot detect a skip-state regression at any count including zero, and D12's sabotage validation attributed to "prefilter+skips" was measuring the prefilter alone. Asserting a skip-table COUNT is the WRONG fix: the cap of 4 buys nothing measurable (730.8 vs 740.1 MB/s at cap 1, interleaved x9). Add a bench case whose hot state actually self-loops (`.*=.*` over a key=value subject is the shape), then the guard has something to measure RESOLVED: THROUGHPUT case (e), `=[^\n]*!` over an 8 MB key=value subject, ~92% of bytes consumed inside the skip loop. NOTE the suggested shape `.*=.*` is WRONG and the case records why: it matches at offset 0 ending at 127, so an 8 MB run exits after 127 bytes and reports 32 GB/s — R2-B4's exit-latency mistake again. Budget 1000 MB/s = measured-median/1.75 (D12). Sabotage-validated: pick_skip_states returning 0 measures 341.7 MB/s and fails the budget, AND trips the case's own hard-error check that a skip table is still emitted.
- [R3.6] STATE:not-started — compare floors.tsv case (i) is 10.4% off the run that verified the others (77.00 vs a recorded 69.72) and its 0.700 margin means this gate CANNOT see it move, so the discrepancy is self-concealing (R3 guards critic F11). The floor values also come from a run that is not in the repository at all — they match neither results-ubuntubudu-20260809.md nor -2.md. Either re-baseline (i) deliberately and record the run, or establish why the latency case drifts; do not leave a floor whose own gate is blind to it
- [R3.7] STATE:not-started — the 0.90 margin CEILING is over-conservative and its stated justification was unmeasured (R3 guards critic F12): "this box's noise floor is ~10% even at median-of-7" appears in D17, gate.sh and floors.tsv and is backed by no measurement in this repo, while the three runs the repo DOES contain move by <=3.3% run-to-run on eight of nine cases. Cases a-h would tolerate 0.95 with 1.5-3x headroom. Collect enough independent runs to earn a tighter ceiling honestly, then raise it — three runs is too thin a basis to gate on, and tightening on it would repeat the error rather than fix it
- [R3.8] STATE:not-started — four of nine bench budgets are LOOSER than the median/1.75 D12 claims for all of them (R3 guards critic F8): COMPILE 3.60x, GCC_O1/O2 9.13x each, LINEARITY 2.08x. The GCC pair sits inside the "9x-300,000x loose" band D12 opens by condemning. Either tighten them to the stated rule or document each exception the way the BITMAP case documents its tighter one. The claim itself has now been asserted three times and refuted twice; it is currently corrected in tests/bench/CLAUDE.md but still stands unfixed in run_bench.sh's header and in D12
- [R3.9] STATE:not-started — bench case (e) is a PRESENCE check with a throughput number attached, not a regression gate (R3 guards critic F19/F22). Capping the skip run at 8 bytes throws away 93% of the loop's reach and still measures 1.15-1.45x ABOVE the 1000 MB/s budget; only near-total deletion (3.1-4.1x) fails it, and the case's own `grep rx_fs[0-9]+\[256\]` hard error already catches deletion for free. D12's own words apply: "a budget that cannot fail is documentation, not a gate". Case (e) also covers ONE forward, NON-accepting skip state — its second emitted skip table (rx_fs3) is entered zero times, so any regression in pick_skip_states' multi-state selection is invisible, and its reverse skip table never executes because the pattern cannot match. REVERSE skip loops have NO throughput coverage anywhere in the suite, which matters because M2.10/D13's negative result rests on the suspicion that a backward byte-at-a-time skip loop loses to the reverse table walk. Either tighten the budget until a graded skip regression fails it, or add a matching subject so the reverse machine runs
- [R3.10] STATE:not-started — run_bench.sh reads /proc/loadavg ONCE, before any measurement, and that single sample decides LOADED for the whole run (R3 guards critic F23). Observed 1-min load on this box during four minutes of measuring: 1.94 -> 6.01 -> 8.93 -> 13.32 -> 16.04, against LOAD_LIMIT 6.0. A run starting at 5.9 is judged quiet and then measures under a load of 13; the critic saw a HEALTHY build median 575.5 and 964.2 MB/s on case (e) in such windows, i.e. a clean tree failing its own gate. Re-read the load AFTER the measurements as well and downgrade to INCONCLUSIVE if either sample is over — the D14 machinery for reporting that already exists
- [R3.2] STATE:completed — R3 had essentially NO adversarial critic coverage: five critics dispatched across the milestone, one usable headline (independent confirmation of the rule-2 overlapping-class break), zero full reports. One design critic claimed '5 more findings' that were requested repeatedly and never arrived — if any apply to the shipped code they are still live and unknown. Partially closed by self-run differential sweeps after the fact: the trie's guards held over 35,280 cases (nested alternations, quantified groups, overlapping classes, `$`, mixed eligible/ineligible branches) and startpos!=0 held over 12,480 cases. The iterative clo_visit rewrite also held: with ONLY that function reverted to its recursive form, 2,294 random patterns emit byte-IDENTICAL C. STILL UNPROBED: (1) the EOL vs non-EOL ordering asymmetry in emit_unanchored (D11); (2) whether D13's dispatch micro-benchmark represents the real emitter shape. (2) IS NOW CLOSED (2026-08-09, D13 addendum): probed against the REAL emitter and HELD. The micro-benchmark does NOT represent the emitter — it never existed in this repo (git log -S confirms the only "dispatch.c" in history is the D13 prose itself), it models neither the forward+reverse double scan, nor the per-iteration accept/prefilter/skip side work, nor the ncls equivalence-class indirection, and for prefilter-eligible patterns most bytes never reach the dispatch loop at all. Re-derived on real emitter output for 3 patterns (768/225/2915 states): goto/table 0.35-0.91 on random input, 2.75-3.07 on predictable input — the R3 "predictability, not size" correction reproduced at realistic scale, direction never flipping. The decisive argument turns out to be COMPILE time, which D13 never makes: verified on a quiet box, gcc -c only, computed goto costs 10.9x / 35.6x / 319x more than tables. "table always" survives more strongly than D13 states it. (1) IS NOW CLOSED TOO (2026-08-09, D11 addendum): swept to 25,834,470 oracle-checked comparisons across 6432 patterns, 0 divergences on the shipped compiler, including under ASan+UBSan; both directions of the asymmetry sabotage-tested (non-EOL order forced onto the EOL path: 238,144 divergences, confirming the rule far more widely than the 53 originally cited; EOL order forced onto the non-EOL path: 0 divergences, so the split is purely a performance decision). Three claims corrected: the speed win exists for ONE pattern family only (the EOL order is a tie or 1.5-4.1% FASTER on five of six throughput cases), the 43% is a gcc -O1/-O2/-O3 artifact that vanishes at -Os and -O0, and the load-bearing premise — accept monotonicity, no state has plain accept 1 with a non-accepting EOL variant — was never written down. Gap closed: the reverse pp+1<n guard now has mid-pattern-`$` behavioural coverage (14 cases vs the 3 that caught it incidentally before). NOTE the critics that produced both halves of R3.2 reported only after being required to append findings to disk as they went; two earlier ones dispatched at the same targets delivered nothing
