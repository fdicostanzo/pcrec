# src/opt — algorithmic optimization passes

Transformations pcrec must do because gcc cannot (APPROACH §5): they change
the algorithm, not the instruction selection. Passes run between DFA
construction (src/ir) and emission (src/gen).

## Files

- **select_engine.c** — per-pattern ENGINE selection ([M4.5b],
  docs/design/engine_m4.md §5.1). Not a transformation like the pass below:
  it answers which engine compiles this pattern, and it exists as a pass
  rather than as compile.c's old inline `if` because of what its future
  customers are. The backrefs-finite expansion and the atomic/possessive cut
  are not analyses that RETURN a verdict, they are REWRITES that DISCHARGE
  one — `(abc)\1` is VM-forced until the expansion turns it into `abcabc`, at
  which point it is DFA-compilable. So the socket carries an optional
  `discharge` hook and the pass is a FIXPOINT with a bound, shipped with zero
  hooks registered (§5.2's own instruction: the bound exists from day one so a
  later rewrite pair cannot loop).

  Exactly ONE analysis is registered today, and its trigger is the requested
  OUTPUT rather than the presence of a `(`: `a(b|c)+d` under `--no-captures`
  is capture-free WORK and stays on the DFA forever. Every other `VM_ONLY`
  registry row is gated by a module with no producer, so the parser refuses
  those patterns long before selection runs — which is also why SR-8's flip is
  smaller than its row implies (§9.1: zero currently-refused constructs become
  compilable when the VM exists).

  This file also owns the §5.6 override's REFUSALS, and it runs before machine
  construction so a caller who asked for an impossible combination pays no
  automaton for the diagnostic. The two refusal triggers are spelled
  differently on purpose (§9.2 item 2): a captures conflict names
  `--no-captures` as the way out, since the caller asked for captures merely by
  not passing it; a `VM_ONLY`-construct conflict names the construct. Only the
  first has a population today, and the second is empty BY POPULATION, not by
  omission.

- **minimize.c** — DFA minimization by Moore-style partition refinement with
  signature hashing. The EOL-view edge (`eolvar`) participates as an extra
  alphabet symbol so `$`-machines minimize correctly. Behavior-preserving:
  priority/leftmost-first semantics are already baked into the transition
  structure before this runs. Shrinks emitted tables (code size + cache).

## Conventions

A TRANSFORMATION pass takes (Ctx *, Dfa *) or (Ctx *, Nfa *), mutates in
place, and must be behavior-preserving — every pass needs corpus coverage that would catch a
semantic change (the full suite runs against post-pass output). Scan-avoidance
analyses that only inform codegen (prefilters, skip states) live in the
emitter instead; move one here if it grows its own IR transformation.

Maintenance: update this file when passes are added/removed.
