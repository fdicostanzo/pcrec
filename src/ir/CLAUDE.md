# src/ir — NFA construction and DFA compilation

Intermediate representation: AST → priority Thompson NFA (nfa.c) → DFA via priority subset construction (dfa.c). Priority ordering on NFA split edges encodes greedy/lazy and alternation preference; subset construction yields a leftmost-first DFA with accept-pruning giving PCRE leftmost-first semantics.

## Files

- **nfa.c** — Thompson NFA construction from AST; split edge order encodes choice preference (D3). Can compile the pattern REVERSED (concat order flipped) for the D7 reverse machine; nfa_wrap_unanchored() adds the lowest-priority start self-loop for one-pass unanchored search; iterative CAT/ALT spine flattening (R1 R-2). M2.8 adds a priority-preserving prefix TRIE for flat alternations (trie_build/trie_key), with two soundness guards documented in D9 — index-range partitioning around a branch that ends mid-trie, and a pairwise-disjointness test before reordering groups. In reverse mode the per-branch key is reversed, so it factors common SUFFIXES
- **dfa.c** — priority subset construction with byte equivalence classes; `prune` on for forward machines (leftmost-first accept-pruning), off for the reverse machine (must keep all threads to find the earliest match start); EOL-variant states for `$` (R1 S-C1/S-C2); per-engine state caps grounded in emitter cost (R1 A-3). Closure visit marks are generation-stamped rather than memset per call, and clo_visit's tail edges are explicit loop iterations so recursion depth no longer depends on gcc's tail-call optimisation (D10)

## Conventions

NFA states are indexed in a flat array; split edges are encoded as `state*2 + slot` (slot 0 = preferred branch, 1 = alternate). Epsilon closure respects split order and prunes lower-priority threads on first ACCEPT. Byte equivalence classes are computed first so DFA transition tables are ncls-wide instead of 256-wide.
